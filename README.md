# Impact-of-Oil-Prices-on-Airline-Revenue
A Comparative Analysis of Oil-Producing vs Non-Oil-Producing Countries .
The core motvation of this project is to empirically examine how crude oil price movements 
translate into revenue movements within the airline industry. This is particularly relevant because 
revenue does not always move in the same direction as cost. Fuel costs may rise, but airlines may 
respond with capacity adjustments, fuel surcharges, pricing strategies, route optimization, or 
demand-stimulating fare promotions. 



The central objectives of the study are threefold: 
1. To investigate the short-term relationship between changes in crude oil prices and changes in 
airline revenue. 
2. To test whether this relationship is statistically significant. 
3. To compare oil-producing and non-oil-producing countries to identify whether their airlines 
respond differently to oil price changes. 
A lag variable for crude oil was included to iden fy whether revenue adjustments occur 
instantaneously or whether they emerge with a delay.
